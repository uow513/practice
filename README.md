  5. Mobile and Tablet Layout Adjustments
  For mobile and tablet versions of your site, these are some design principles:
  
  Mobile Menu
  Use a hamburger menu (three lines) for the main navigation, which expands when clicked.
  Forms
  All forms (Login/Signup) should have large, clickable buttons and large input fields for ease of use on smaller screens.
  Content
  Content like the problem listings should display in single columns with large tap targets (clickable areas) for easy navigation.
  Text Size & Buttons: Adjust the text size and button size for readability on mobile.
  Category Filters
  On desktop, these can be side-by-side, but on mobile/tablet, turn these into dropdown menus for space efficiency.
  Content Density
  Keep content minimal and make sure the layout doesn't feel crowded. Prioritize important actions and information.

Tables for users, questions, answers, solutions, categories, and quizzes.
Security: Encrypt passwords, use HTTPS, and validate inputs to avoid security risks.
Search Engine: Implement a powerful search feature (e.g., Elasticsearch) for users to easily find problems.
Scalability: Ensure the backend can scale if the site grows and more users or problems are added.
5. Monetization Ideas
Freemium Model: Offer basic access for free, with premium membership for more features (advanced questions, hints, extra tools).
Ads: You can place non-intrusive ads for revenue generation.
Subscription Plans: For users who want premium content, advanced math courses, or one-on-one tutoring.
6. Design & UX
User-Friendly Interface: Clean, intuitive design. Focus on easy navigation.
Dark/Light Mode Option: Many students prefer dark mode for reading long problems.
Mobile Optimization: Ensure the site is fully responsive for mobile users.
Minimalist Design: Let the questions and answers be the focal point; avoid clutter.
Next Steps:
Wireframe: Start by sketching a layout or wireframe of the main pages.
Tech Stack: Decide on your tech stack (e.g., React, Node.js, MongoDB for the backend, etc.).
Prototype: Build a basic prototype of the website to showcase the core functionality.
Testing: Have a small group of users test the site and gather feedback.
